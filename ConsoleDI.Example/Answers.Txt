1. Why is it important that the IReportServiceLifetime class is an Interface?
Using an interface allows the application code to be decoupled from specific implementations, making it more flexible and easier to maintain. 
It also promotes loose coupling and better testability, as implementations can be easily replaced without modifying the dependent classes.

2. What are the three types of service lifetimes available for use here? What is the difference between them?
Transient Lifetime, Scoped Lifetime and Singleton Lifetime.
Transient lifetime is suitable for scenarios where you need a new independent instance every time.
Scoped lifetime is suitable for scenarios where you need to share the same instance within the same scope.
Singleton lifetime is suitable for scenarios where you need global sharing of a single instance throughout the application.

3. Using the above information, what do we expect the lifetime is of an instance of a DbContext class injected into an Endpoint method? Into a seed method? 
The lifecycle of a DbContext class instance can be Transient or Scoped.
The lifecycle of DbContext class instance into a seed method should be Transient.
